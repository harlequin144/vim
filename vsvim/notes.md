Unfortunately vsvim doesn't seem to recognize a short cut to the vsvim file.
Since I don't want to put my git repo in my home folder, I'll have to maintain
this copy of the vsvim file here. 

To install the `_vimrc` file, use `:set vimrc` or `:set vimrcpaths` to find out
where to put it. Copy and paste it there.
